# add-thing
This script/app is intended to make it super easy to save any\* string of text directly from the terminal.

\* Strings of ridiculous length have not been tested.

# getting started
How to add a thing:
```powershell
python add.py a new thing
```

From there, your thing is stored safely to disk.
- No syncing
- No cloud
- No free salsa

Just the plain, ol' disk.
