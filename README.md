# add-thing
This script/app is intended to make it super easy to save any\* string of text directly from the terminal.

\* Strings of ridiculous length have not been tested.

# getting started
How to add a thing:
```powershell
python add.py a new thing
```

From there, your thing is stored safely to disk.
- No syncing
- No cloud
- No free salsa

Just the plain, ol' disk.

# what happens next?
The things should probably get processed by something. The processor may not be known or even considered at time of thing entry.

So, the processor maybe should run at thing entry time or at a deliberate point later.
